# Space-Invaders-Pygame
My first pygame... work in progress
ALMOST DONEEEE just gotta add some twist...heheheh
i just reached line over 200 lines! and i am done with the base game

note: idk why i was so excited


## Ignore this if you already have pygame:
# P.S. if your too lazy to manually install pygame, run the .ps1 file if on windows, otherwise run this in the shell:
`cd ~` - so it installs everywhere(i'm paranoid)
`pip3 install pygame` - installs pygame
# Done!

# DEPENDENCIESES:
1. A device with a display
2. Python, this should work on the newest version but i haven't tested it yet.just go to the python website and install it, it's a coding language(not a virus)well it just lets yoy run python code, which is the language i used to code this

# It's not that good, its literally a moving spaceship shooting a buncha moving enemies. idk why i like it so much
