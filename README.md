ALMOST DONEEEE just gotta add some twist...heheheh

note: idk why i was so excited

# Ignore this if you already have python and pygame:
# P.S. if your too lazy to manually install pygame, run the .ps1 file, otherwise run:
`cd ~` - so it installs everywhere(i'm paranoid)
`pip3 install pygame` - installs pygame
# Done!
