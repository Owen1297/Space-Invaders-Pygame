# Space-Invaders-Pygame
My first pygame... work in progress
ALMOST DONEEEE just gotta add some twist...heheheh
i just reached line over 200 lines! and i am done with the base game

note: idk why i was so excited


## Ignore this if you already have pygame:
### if your too lazy to manually install pygame, run the .ps1 file if on windows, otherwise run this in the shell:
`cd ~` - so it installs everywhere(i'm paranoid)
`pip3 install pygame` - installs pygame
## Done!

# DEPENDENCIESES:
1. A device with a display
2. Python, this should work on the newest version but i haven't tested it yet.just go to the python website and install it, it's a coding language(not a virus)well it just lets yoy run python code, which is the language i used to code this

# INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Press the code button, then download zip
2. Unzip it once downloaded, if on windows then yoy can select it and press the "extract all" button
3. Run the file, most of the time yoy can double click it or select it and press enter, if it shows an error or a shell pops up then disappears, then yoy have to run it from the terminal with `python3 main.py`, once inside the unzipped directory, ill fix this later
4. Enjoy!
